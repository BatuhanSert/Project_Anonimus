## Vision Statement

&emsp;The number of <b>passwords</b> that emerged with the Internet's inclusion in our lives has increased.
Passwords must be used everywhere, such as credit card passwords, pin codes, security codes,
program passwords, e-mail account passwords, debit passwords.<br />
&emsp;Passwords that cannot be guessed easily and are very difficult to know by trying are called
<i>“strong passwords”.</i> One password should not be used for more than one account.<br />
&emsp;Creating and remembering a strong, reliable, and easy-to-remember password is one of the
biggest challenges for many internet users.<br />
&emsp;We want to present our users their passwords with a simple interface. It will be sufficient to
enter the name of the website or application where they will use the password and choose the
ones they want from the features we have specified.<br />
&emsp;Easily guessable information such as zip code, house number, telephone number, your child's
name, surname, date of birth, etc. should not be used as passwords.<br />
&emsp;The password you create can be considered strong depending on a number of features.<br />

## Major Features

&emsp;<b>ANONIMUS</> mobile app t offers its users strong, hard-to-crack passwords with a simple
interface. While doing this, it allows them to choose the features they want. For example, a
password consisting of only numbers can be created, or a combination of numbers and letters
can also be created. At the same time, we want to prevent any confusion that may occur with
the name of the website or application they will enter in order to specify which password they
can use where.<br />
&emsp;If you want to have a very secure password, you can enrich your password with numbers,
uppercase letters, lowercase letters and various symbols such as question marks or commas.
On the other hand, strong and difficult passwords that you will generate in this way are not
ideal for keeping in memory. The user can choose the length of the password.<br />
&emsp;With ANONIMUS you can easily manage your passwords.<br />
&emsp;The password you create can be considered strong depending on a number of features.<br />
&emsp;&emsp;- The password must consist of at least four characters or more,<br />
&emsp;&emsp;- Using uppercase and lowercase letters side by side.<br />
&emsp;&emsp;- Use numbers, sequences, and special characters similar to #, %, +, -,?, @, !, *, % next <br />
&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;to letters.<br />
